# WATCH - Wildlife AI Technology for Critter Handling

## 🚀 Overview  
WATCH is an AI-powered surveillance system designed to mitigate Human-Wildlife Conflict (HWC). By leveraging AI and CCTV, the system detects harmful wild animals and sends real-time alerts, ensuring safety for both humans and wildlife.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Detect and identify wildlife using AI and CCTV.  
- Alert authorities and communities about potential threats.  
- Promote coexistence between humans and wildlife.  

## 🛠 Implementation  
1. **CCTV Surveillance** – Monitors human-wildlife boundaries.  
2. **AI Algorithm** – Identifies animals based on trained models.  
3. **Alert Mechanism** – Sends real-time notifications to stakeholders.  

## 📊 Statistics  
- Over **527 deaths** in big cat attacks (last 9 years).  
- Major human casualties reported in **West Bengal, Jharkhand, Assam, and Tamil Nadu**.  
- **Key conflict species**: Tiger, Elephant, Leopard, Sloth Bear.  

## 🔍 Existing Methods vs WATCH  
| **Method** | **Limitations** |
|------------|----------------|
| PIT Tags | Requires manual animal tagging |
| E-Collars | Limited range, expensive |
| Drones | High maintenance, weather-dependent |
| WATCH (Our Solution) | Real-time AI surveillance with automated alerts |

## 🎯 Trained AI Model  
Our AI model is trained to detect:  
🐅 **Tiger** | 🐘 **Elephant** | 🐆 **Leopard** | 🐻 **Sloth Bear**  

## 🌍 Expected Impact  
- **Faster response times** to wildlife intrusions.  
- **Reduced human and wildlife casualties**.  
- **Data-driven insights** for conservation research.
